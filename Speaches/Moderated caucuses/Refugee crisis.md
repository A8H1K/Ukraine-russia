### Solution%%
China would like to applaud the european union for Opening up safe routes to sanctuary for refugees, for itÂ is one important solution. That means allowing people to reunite with their relatives, and giving refugees visas so they don't have to spend their life savings and risk drowning to reach safety. 2. It also means resettling all refugees who need it. however this was a problem that has to be handled internally within europe and countries with citizens stuck in ukraine during the crisis. This is not something to be discussed further and the delegate would urge the assembly to focus on the main issue instead of wandering around.
