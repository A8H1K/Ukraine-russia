- The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) is a free trade agreement between the Asia-Pacific nations of Australia, Brunei, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, and Vietnam.
- The situations in Ukraine and in Taiwan are not comparable because Ukraine is a sovereign country that was attacked by another country, while Taiwan is part of China and is recognized as such by the world.

# Chinese policy
DISEC deals with international security as well as disarmament—so you are suggested to understand China’s standpoint on this kind of issues.

1.  China is always tough. In almost all the international affairs, China always has a firm standpoint, it rarely sway, or even change. So you should be steadfast on your arguments.
2.  China is an advocator of world peace. In Chinese history, China has rarely invaded any other countries. Because of this, China don’t want to see any wars, nor to participate in them.
3.  China is ready to provide aids to those countries in chaos. Aids include fund, resources, humanity people. Not military！！
4.  Find your allies. On this topic, China will not ally with Russia or the US. China is more like to be eclectic, so find the eclectic countries and cooperate.
5.  Stand out to make claims. This is China’s style. China has confidence, for its strong economy and social peace.
