# Chinese views
- framing in western media is misleading

# Call between chinese and Russian presidents

#### Highlighted three points
1. Call was constructive
2. Instruct people to take concrete relations to get chinese US relations back to the right track
3. Proper measures need to be taken to resolve the Ukrainian crisis

Can the US honour the decisions taken during this call?

How does chinese public opinion view this conflict?
1. Seperate public opinion from official opinion(even though public opinion matters)
2. We are an Impartial, neutral and objective participant, which we believe is the only effective path to a peaceful solution


## Options for Chinese Leader if conflict drags on
1.  Conflict will likely drag on
2. Doesnt have much impact on China's stance
3. Economics does not play a big role
4. CHINA WILL NOT TOLERATE UNDERMINING THE SECURITY INTERESTS OF ANY OTHER COUNTRY

1. Ball was in US court
2. Russia Is nowhere near as isolated as western media seems to believe
	## Russian Allies include:-
	- India (Rupee - Ruble system)
	- Opec countries:-
		- Pakistan 
		- Iran
3. This will be doubly difficult with efforts to isolate China, as event though Russia can threaten countries with its nuclear weapons. China isnt only a major nuclear power it is also an Economic Superpower

Q - China banking with russia to make a block against the west. Would that be a concern for china?
- China's world view is that it wants to see a just and humane order without any country engaging in these kind of power politics or cold war thinking


## Main focus should be economic impact, energy and food crisis
- Many analysts focused on the energy sector say that germany should be much closer to russia than US, but its taboo to question atlanticism

# Washington's views
1. Ultimate future of what happens in ukraine is dependant on what happens in China and Ukraine
2. US threatened China against providing aid
3. If china doesn't provide troops, amo and food. Maybe Russia will negotiate with Ukrainians
4. China could be Neutral co-ordinator
5. China, Only country with influence on Russia
6. China, Strong trade relations with Europe
7. Before Putin started conflict he talked to Xi

---
1. China should be more concerned about [[Taiwan]]
2. Biden threatened with economic consequences.
3. Maybe seperate China from trade
4. This might have consequences 
---
1. Germany was leaning toward Russia but after the conflict it has switched sides
2. Germany gave offensive equipment to Ukraine, moving away from post ww2 policies
---
## Future Relations b/w Us, China and EU
1. Great impact

# London's views
1. China's positions hasnt changed
2. China wants peaceful resolution
3. Public level - Russian side
4. China is in a dillema, Either prioritise economic or political interest
5. China prioritises long term political interest
6. China still on defence

---
1. Seems to be an economic vaccum
2. China can't stop the crisis with a phone call even after being influential(International system of sovereign states)
3. Especially if Ukraine is High Stakes for Russia
4. China wouldnt want to be seen as interfering directly then failing(Bad with PR)
---
## Future relations
