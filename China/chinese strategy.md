the u.s president warns china of

consequences if it helps russian forces

in ukraine beijing blames washington for

the war and says sanctions will hurt the

global economy so what's china's

[[strategy]] on ukraine and will it hurt

relations with the west this is inside

story

hello and welcome to the program i'm

fully bhattibo it's been nearly a month

since russia invaded ukraine and there's

been no sign of any de-escalation

russian forces have targeted several

regions in the last few days including

the besieged city of mario paul in the

south while the fighting rages on world

leaders are attempting to find a

diplomatic solution u.s president joe

biden and chinese leader xi jinping

spoke on the phone on friday for the

first time since the war began

washington is concerned about beijing's

stance on the conflict chinese officials

have refused to condemn the invasion

biden has warned of consequences for

china if it provides material support to

moscow but the white house hasn't given

details on what those consequences might

include

we have a range of tools that could be

considered and sanctions are certainly

one tool in the toolbox as they are for

other countries as well even if we as we

have not outlined specific consequences

and we'll we'll communicate those

directly to china and of course with our

european partners and counterparts

meanwhile china's ambassador to ukraine

has sprays the strength of the ukrainian

people in a message that was a slight

departure from the official line in

beijing ukraine state media quoted fan

shing wrong saying china is a friendly

country for the ukrainian people as an

ambassador i can responsibly say that

our country will forever be a good force

for ukraine both economically and

politically he says will always respect

your state and develop relations on the

basis of equality and mutual benefit

here's al jazeera's katrina u in beijing

now with more on the call between the

u.s and chinese leaders according to

chinese readout it says that uh

president xi jinping told joe biden that

both countries had the responsibility to

de-escalate tensions that fighting was

in nobody's interest and also he

repeated china's stance that sanctions

would not be effective in ending of the

war and would only serve to damage the

global economy that was already

struggling to recover from the pandemic

now we know for the u.s part uh that joe

biden emphasized that there would be

material uh costs or there would be

consequences for materially supporting

russia in its efforts to invade ukraine

although the us did not state what these

consequences would be

u.s officials have asserted that russian

officials have asked china for military

support from military aid in the form of

equipment um in in terms of helping to

uh engage in this war something that

both moscow and beijing have denied uh

president biden also went on to uh share

his own view of the war and put forward

the us and its allies efforts to stop

russia's invasion and presumably try to

get china on board with that however we

have seen no indication whatsoever that

he was successful in this and in fact by

the end of this call as long as it did

last we've seen no sign whatsoever that

china's position has changed

well let's bring in our guests for

today's inside story in beijing andy

mark a senior research fellow at the

center for china and globalization and a

professor at beijing foreign studies

university in washington lawrence korb a

former assistant secretary of defense

and a senior fellow at the center for

american progress and in

london zeno leone a lecturer in war

studies at king's college london and an

affiliate of the university lao china

institute a warm welcome to you all

gentlemen thank you for being on inside

story uh andy mark in beijing let me

start with you please um as katrina said

there in her report the call between

president biden and president xi doesn't

seem to have changed anything in either

leaders or either country's position

but you believe that this was a

significant and an important call why is

that

i do believe this was an important call

i think uh first of all the framing and

the western media uh really is uh

misleading and

uh really there being nothing more than

dutiful stenographers for the us

government

uh if you read the singha

readout of the call it makes three

points uh the first that both presidents

thought the call was constructive the

second point which is the most important

one is that both presidents will

instruct uh their people

to take concrete actions to

uh ensure that the china-us relationship

is back on the right track and finally

the issue that is urgent and consuming

the intention of the world is that

both sides also agree that proper

measures need to be taken to resolve the

ukrainian crisis and i think it's the

second point that's really important and

the key here is can the us muster the

political courage that is necessary to

honor the

uh decisions taken during this call so

this is why i think this was actually a

very very important call andy you talk

about the framing in western media of

this conflict i wonder how does chinese

public opinion view this conflict in

ukraine well you know on social media in

the past few days there seems to have

been a shift uh in in chinese social

media how are they seeing this conflict

isn't it bad pr for china to be

sustaining uh these ties with russia

right now when civilians are being

bombed

well i think we have to separate public

opinion in china from the official

position and public opinion of course

matters but what matters more i think is

the government's uh position on this and

this has been consistent uh all along

the china has

long said that it is on the side of

peaceful development

and

that i think a couple things i would

maybe question here that

uh

that it's a month in and russia still

has not backed down if we really

understand the

causes of this conflict they're complex

clearly there are heated

disagreements and of course violent

disagreements on both sides of this

question

but frankly

china has said that it is an impartial

neutral and objective

uh participant in this and not taking

one side or the other which i think is

the only effective path to a peaceful

solution uh larry lawrence kobe i'll ask

you uh about this in just a second

whether china is a neutral participant

but i want to get your thoughts first on

this call between president xi

uh and uh president biden uh this long

phone conversation they had is it a

watershed moment do you think as

andy does that this was an important

call

oh i think it was very important because

really

the ultimate uh future of what happens

in ukraine is dependent on both china

and the united states and so i think it

was important for president biden to

connect with president xi and explain to

him

what the united states would do

if in fact china provides

more aid

to russia because right now

at least according to u.s reports russia

is running out of evil ammunition and

even food for the troops and so if china

doesn't provide that then maybe russia

will be willing to negotiate with the

ukrainians who have already announced

their might pull back from their desire

to join nato

so

on the question of china's neutrality

that andy uh wasn't talking about there

is china do you agree with him that

china is it could be a neutral mediator

in this conflict

i think very definitely that china could

because china has very strong trade

relations with europe which is part of

this uh conflict they're the only

country in the world that really still

has influence on russia i think it was

very interesting that before putin

invaded he went to uh beijing to talk to

xi and didn't do it till the olympics

were over so it wouldn't distract from

china's

attention on the uh on the olympics yes

they they do have it the united states

its european allies and even some

countries in asia have all come out

against russia but if china continues to

try and help them it will be russia will

have less incentive to end this conflict

on a negotiated solution

okay zeno let me bring you into the

conversation uh and you know the

slight and subtle change in rhetoric

we've seen in chinese media uh recently

in the last few days at least

when it comes to the war in ukraine

they're focused on the humanitarian and

the refugee crisis the tweet also from

the chinese ambassador to the to ukraine

quite significant uh china providing

humanitarian aid to ukraine as well how

should we view this do you think china's

position is evolving uh and has evolved

since the conflict began

and i think since the conflict began

china's position substantially hasn't

really changed there was always great

concern and great emphasis on

the drama

experienced by ukrainian people and

emphasis on trying to find

a peaceful resolution

however at least on a public level china

continues to be on the side of russia

and of course

here

china is

a dilemma

which is

should should it go should it prioritize

economic interest or political interest

because if it was to prioritize economic

interest it was

it would obviously

try to um make its conversation with the

west with europe more productive

but actually china we know there's a

pattern right we've seen this pattern

during this crisis uh china normally

tends to prioritize long-term political

interests and china really needs at this

stage of its um grand strategic

trajectory a

a partner partners in plural and

certainly russia is one of those so i

think china china's position hasn't

substantially changed it's still on

defense uh concern for ukraine but

doesn't not ready to let russia go yet

okay let's take a closer look now at

china's economic ties with some of the

key players in this crisis and what's at

stake u.s trade with china has grown

enormously in recent decades and is

crucial for both nations the united

states imports more from china than from

any other nation in 2021 nearly half of

china's 3.3 trillion dollars in exports

went to the u.s and its allies that

number is far higher than its trade with

moscow which hit a record annual high of

more than 146 billion dollars last year

and trade between china and the eu was

worth more than 800 billion dollars for

the same period andy mark in beijing

zeno says a difficult balancing act for

china what are the options then for

chinese leaders

if this conflict drags on

well i think unfortunately uh

i think all indications despite

everyone's hope that it can be resolved

soon

uh will likely drag on

i'm not sure that it really has much of

an impact on

china's stance or its policy decisions i

agree with you know that i think that

really china's

stance despite some uh positive rhetoric

from the or statements from the

ukrainian ambassador as you said

uh really has not changed and the

economics of this

does not play uh that big of a role uh

the important thing here i think that

china's been very very clear is that

whether in europe or whether in asia

what it will not tolerate is any country

undermining the security interests of

other countries in the region and this

is a message that i think has been

delivered very clearly and resolutely

to the us most recently in this

call between the two presidents c and

biden lawrence corp do you agree with

this andy says the economics of this

don't play a big role

i think an issue that's more important

to china here is the whole question of

taiwan

because they see russia

claiming ukraine back to part of russia

the same way that they see taiwan as

part of china and that sort of goes in

combination with the economic interest

they have both concerns and i think

that's really plays in this in fact what

we hear from the call is when biden

started talking about ukraine china

started talking about taiwan so that is

very important to them not just the

economic consideration but i think what

biden made clear to them is these

economic consequences as you just

pointed out here with the amount of

trade with the u.s and the european

union could really have pretty severe uh

consequences for china what consequences

precisely would the the biden

administration be considering here would

the u.s go as far as isolating

china economically in the same way that

russia finds itself isolated and

sanctioned today

i think they would move in that

direction the real que and by i don't

think biden knows exactly now because

these obviously would have severe

impacts on the united states as well as

our european nation so that really is

the key question so it's really up to

china now as we say in the us the ball

is in their court they want to help

russia by providing ammunition right now

or they're going to maintain their

neutrality and then try and start

negotiation because remember

negotiations are already ongoing i think

china could play a positive role and

tell

russia you know you can come out ahead

with this you they'll recognize your

annexation of crimea there'll be more

independence in the donbass region and

ukraine won't join nato and you can

declare that a victory

they know your thoughts about this how

likely is it that china

could push russia to end the war and

withdraw from ukraine

so i think what we've learned from the

meeting between

baiden and xi and also in the last few

months and from this crisis is that

actually there seems to be a bit of an

epidemiologic

vacuum

uh where nobody is able to really stop

child russia and also we we need to

understand that the international system

of sovereign states it doesn't work

in a way that

you know somebody in beijing only

because china is a very influential

power can just pick up the phone and and

stop putting doing whatever he's doing

especially when ukraine is such a high

stake for

uh for russia

so on the one hand china is probably the

most likely um player uh to to be able

to uh achieve something meaningful from

a diplomatic point of view because the

eu nato and the us liberally cannot at

the moment on the other hand that

doesn't mean that

china has all this influence that many

people think and especially men in the

us

hopes that china would have on on

russia so um and this is also why china

remains on defense because perhaps he

wouldn't want to be seen as

interfering directly with the country

trying to stop it and then maybe failing

because that would have a negative

impact on its influence if china would

look like a great power that perhaps has

only influence over small powers but not

in a major crisis like this one

andy in beijing your thoughts about this

well i like lawrence's phrase uh that

the ball is in someone's court but i

would say that the ball is in the us's

court for two reasons

uh first that russia is nowhere near as

isolated as the united states or western

media would like to make it out to be uh

first of all let's look at india who's

very clearly said that they're looking

to set up a rupee ruble uh exchange with

russia to continue trading with russia

look at the opec countries for whom

russia has been a very crucial voice on

the u.n security council

uh pakistan iran uh so i think the

efforts to isolate russia really are not

going as well as the us is portraying

and this will be doubly if not triply

true for efforts to isolate china

because while what russia can do is

threaten nato and the us with nuclear

attacks

china is not only a nuclear power it's

an economic superpower so it will be

even more damaging i think to countries

like the us that would try to impose any

kind of economic sanctions right uh on

china let me ask you this

about this viewpoint andy that that a

lot of commentators are making right now

and that is president xi was banking

on on putin uh and and his own country

in china to form a unified strong bloc

against the against the west another

block against the west i mean a weaker

russia whether they come out victorious

from this war or not

i mean

would that not sit not sit well with the

cha with the chinese i mean russia

regardless of you know whether they win

in ukraine will come out somewhat uh

weaker from this conflict isn't that a

concern for china

well i think very briefly china's world

view uh is that it wants to see a more

just and humane order without any

country engaging in these kind of

power politics cold war thinking but i

think the more important point here is

that really the case what about the

issue of taiwan i mean that was top of

the conversation between president biden

and president xi taiwan the implications

for taiwan

sure well again uh taiwan is the

cornerstone of u.s china relations

because china sees this as an internal

matter and others around the world

perhaps don't but i think i want to

really emphasize here that there's too

much attention paid to the military

conflict in ukraine but in fact we need

to focus on i think where the real

battle is which is economic and what

about if energy prices food prices

double and triple

what is that going to do to europe we're

already seeing uh the early devastating

impact from three million refugees uh

come next winter if this conflict is

still going on and energy prices double

and triple food prices are increasing i

think this will uh severely test if not

shatter european unity and in particular

um

germany i think many analysts in the

financial world that focus on the energy

sector say that

germany really should be much closer to

russia than the us but it's taboo at

this point okay to question atlanticism

let's bring in i think we have to see

yeah we have to see indeed let's bring

in larry in washington dc larry your

thoughts about this how will this war

define first of all future relations

between the us and china but also

between china and europe lawrence gold

well i think it's going to have a great

impact i think our colleague from

beijing is right that there's going to

be severe economic consequences for everybody involved they're also going to be economic consequences for china not just the united states and it's very interesting that andy mentioned germany because up until now germany had been leading toward russia but after this started germany not only canceled the north stream pipeline but basically gave offensive equipment to ukraine in other words germany has ended its post cold war opposed world war ii uh policy of really remaining neutral and is becoming more aggressive nobody wins the longer this goes on i agree the real question is can china and the u.s
come to our understanding that profits everybody because i i think that china would like to see a new world order in which china and russia sort of confront the united states and end the period of u.s hegemony and that's going to be the real question how does this end and he's right the whole world doesn't support it but i am really surprised that asian countries singapore japan they have also joined in putting these uh sanctions on so it's really i think it's a pivotal moment for the international community here how this ends up because the ramifications will go on for decades okay zeno leone in london your thoughts can china and the u.s come to an understanding and what will russia's success or failure in ukraine mean for you know global security in the years to come and the global economy so it's a very beautiful moment for the world order and first of all to answer your first question the problems between the us and china they go they're structural and they go beyond this crisis we have just forgotten about those problems because now ukraine is on the front page of every newspapers um why is a pivotal moment for the world order the world order is already somehow experiencing a degree of decoupling on the one hand the us trying to move beyond the liberal order with the better world of joe biden decoupling in some areas from china china is trying to do exactly the same with the common prosperity campaign the westernization so this crisis it's pivotal because it might accelerate this trend this is part of the coupling and so it's very critical for us to to understand and to see where the partnership between china and russia is going because if it holds there might be um quite an important acceleration of this trend of the coupling where we will see two partially detached spare of influence um the chinese one still very much in the making looking at the developing world and the u.s one which will probably include um those countries those those few countries that have joined in uh imposing sanctions uh against russia so australia japan canada and the eu all
