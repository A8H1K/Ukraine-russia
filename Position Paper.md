The Russo-Ukrainian War is an ongoing war between Russia (together with pro-Russian separatist forces) and Ukraine. It was started by Russia in February 2014 following the Ukrainian Revolution of Dignity, and initially focused on the status of Crimea and the Donbas, internationally recognised as part of Ukraine.


# China's stance on the conflict
The People's Republic of China believes that All parties should push for a proper settlement of the ukraine russia crisis in a responsible manner, china is willing to continue to offer mutual support to russia on issues concerning core interests and major concerns such as sovereignity and security. China is also against the sanctions levied by the west on Russia for it is not only impacting Russia but the global economy too,  They might lead to failures and unattanded consequences. Especially if applied against a global superpower and a large scale exporter of goods like Russia.

# China's Role in the conflict
In february, Putin and XI signed a wide ranging strategic partnership aimed at countering US influence and said they would have 'No forbidden' areas of cooperation. Even though china and ukraine have built a strong trading foundation, china even became Ukraine's largest trading partner. Yet china believes. The West should recognize the principle of the indivisibility of security, which holds that the security of one country shall not be fulfilled at the expense of the security of other countries; and that this principle must become the basis of a new international security architecture. China, like Europe, wants the war in Ukraine to end as soon as possible, but the conflict drags on because of U.S. involvement. China also does not support unilateral Western sanctions against Russia because the United States uses these sanctions as a way to expand its influence and geoeconomic reach.
