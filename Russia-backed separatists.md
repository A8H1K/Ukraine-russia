# **Moscow, Russia –** 
Since fighting broke out in eastern Ukraine in 2014, separatist rebels of the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics have been accused of being proxies for Russian interests, if not simply Russian soldiers in disguise.

The conflict in Ukraine’s Donbas region is therefore framed as a war between Russia and Ukraine, in Ukrainian and most Western media, as opposed to a civil war.

Despite efforts by the central government in Kyiv, Ukraine is deeply divided, with a large Russian and Russian-speaking minority, especially in the south and east of the country.

Some in these regions viewed the [[Maidan revolution]] of early 2014 as an ultranationalist uprising, involving far-right paramilitaries such as Right Sector, with echoes of the anti-Soviet partisans which collaborated with the Nazis in WWII.
