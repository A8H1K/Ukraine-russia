## Why did Russia not attack Latvia and Estonia?

President Putin was elected in 2012 with 63.6% of votes in Russia . Whereas Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia on **29 March 2004**, they officially became members of NATO, making it harder for russia to liberate them. Another reason, the Estonian and Latvian nationalisation could have generated conflict between ethnic Russians on the one hand and Estonians in Estonia and Latvians in Latvia on the other hand.
- Adding to the same the two countries are about a 1000 kms away from moscow
